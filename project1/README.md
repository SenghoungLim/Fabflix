# Connection Pooling
  - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling.
  Context.xml\
  SearchServlet (Data source connection and statement for the project)\
  pom.xml\
  Every endpoint access the database
  - #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.
  The connection pooling is unitilizaed in the search field fabflix to help manage and reuse database connections, this will help performance because doing a connection each time to the backend it can be 
  costly, but with connection pooling it can be reused and pay once. In addition, there is a limit to the connections that we created, this gives a more predictable amount of load and prevent unexpected 
  failure which can be found in context.xml with this statement "maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"". 
  - #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.
  It works the same either with two or more backend, its job is to efficiently manage and reuse database connections to improve the performance and scalability of applications.
    

# Master/Slave
  - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.
    All the configuration related to routing are in AWS instances.
  - #### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
    Onec the the load balancer in instance 1 receive the requests, it will distribute the read/write requests to tomcat instances in this case Master/Slave, this will help improve the incoming traffc prevent 
    crashes to the system. 

# JMeter TS/TJ Time Logs
  - #### Instructions of how to use the `log_processing.*` script to process the JMeter logs.
  - cd 2023-fall-cs122b-jake/project1/src
  - javac log_processing.java
  - java log_processing
  - log_processing.java reads log.txt generated by FullSearchServelet.java and it calculates the TJ and TS of the request(s)
